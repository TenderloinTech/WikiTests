## Why make HuskyLink?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our all-freshman campus, countless students have struggled with finding the help they need to succeed in their intro to CS classes. Many of their friends are too busy with thier own work to offer assistance, or understand the material even worse. No matter the the teachers or students try to do, from pair programming to an entire club dedicated to helping with homework, many are still falling behind in CS.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our peers find partners, we at Tenderloin Tech are debuting our very first project: HuskyLink! With HuskyLink, students can find like-minded peers in desperate need of CS help. To make it easier to connect, the users can add descriptions and lots of tags, from their location on campus to their skills and hobbies. And if you don't want to put your info, that's not a problem either! Everyone with a confirmed email can anonymously browse the website.
