## Why make HuskyLink?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our Northeastern University all-freshman campus, countless students have struggled with finding the help they need to succeed in their CS classes. Many of their friends are too busy with their own work to offer assistance, or understand the material even less. No matter what the teachers or students try to do, from pair programming to an entire club dedicated to helping with homework, many are still falling behind in CS.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our peers find partners, we at Tenderloin Tech are debuting our very first project: HuskyLink! With HuskyLink, students can find like-minded peers in desperate need of CS help. To make it easier to connect, the users can add descriptions and lots of tags, from their location on campus to their skills and hobbies. And if you don't want to put your info, that's not a problem either! Everyone with a confirmed email can anonymously browse the website.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HuskyLink's front end is heavily inspired of off dating apps such as Bumble and Hinge, with some elements from Amazon and Ebay. Our front end is designed to be as accessible as possible to everyone, no matter their level of experience.

## Future of HuskyLink
We plan to continue working on HuskyLink long after the end of the hackathon. Some of our plans include:
1. Adding more tags, as well as other options to filter for the perfect CS partner
2. Scale the program to support every single Northeastern campus 
3. Add the ability to search for study partners outside of CS
4. Giving the app to our college's school of computer science, making HuskyLink official
